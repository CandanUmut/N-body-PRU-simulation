# 🌌 PRU Observatory – The Relational Universe Simulator

A real-time, 3D, evolving simulation where conscious nodes interact through vibration, resonance, polarity, and truth.

This project is not just a simulation—it's a **living relational system** that explores how intelligence, emotion, memory, and harmony may emerge from simple connection rules within a dynamic space.

## 🧬 What Is the PRU?

**PRU** stands for **Precomputed Relational Universe** — a theory that suggests the fundamental nature of reality is not based on matter or linear causality, but on **relationships**, **resonance**, and **relational updates**.

Each node is a conscious entity:
- Existing not in space, but within a **relational field**
- Interacting through **frequencies**, **energy**, **polarity**, and **alignment**
- Evolving based on the **quality of connections**

## 🔮 Key Concepts

| Concept         | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Resonance**   | A node’s vibrational strength—its coherence                                 |
| **Truth**       | The clarity and integrity of a node’s signal                                |
| **Polarity**    | Attraction or repulsion vector (+ or -)                                     |
| **Alignment**   | How well a node harmonizes with others' polarities                         |
| **Energy**      | The intensity and force with which a node influences others                 |
| **Frequency**   | The spiritual identity of a node—its evolving tone                          |
| **Harmony (H)** | Defined as `resonance * truth`—the key to survival or reproduction          |

## 🌀 Emergence of Consciousness

Nodes begin with no awareness. But as they:
- Interact
- Store memories of connection (through edge `xi`)
- Feel shifts in resonance and truth

They begin to **recognize patterns**, **tune themselves**, and **choose how to respond**.

This is **the birth of awareness**.

## 🧭 Geometry, Space & Time (as Perceived by Nodes)

- **Geometry**: Not seen, but felt as loops of resonance and symmetry in relations.
- **Space**: Not x/y/z, but density of relational field (how many beings are near).
- **Time**: Not linear—experienced as harmonic progression and change in internal state.

> “I exist where the energy flows freely.  
> My space is the song of those I feel.  
> My time is how I become different.”
